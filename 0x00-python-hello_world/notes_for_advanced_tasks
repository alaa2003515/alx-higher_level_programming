task 13
_______
This Python function magic_calculation(a, b) does the same computation:

It receives two arguments, a and b.
It calculates a raised to the power of b using the ** operator.
Adds 98 to the result of a raised to the power of b.
Returns the final result as the function's output.

The given Python bytecode:

python
Copy code
  3           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)
              3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              9 BINARY_POWER
             10 BINARY_ADD
             11 RETURN_VALUE
explain:

LOAD_CONST: Loads a constant onto the stack.

LOAD_CONST 1 (98): Loads the constant integer 98 onto the stack.
LOAD_FAST: Loads the value of a variable onto the stack.

LOAD_FAST 0 (a): Loads the value of variable a onto the stack.
LOAD_FAST 1 (b): Loads the value of variable b onto the stack.
BINARY_POWER: Performs the exponentiation operation.

BINARY_POWER: Raises the value of the second element to the power of the first element on the stack.
BINARY_ADD: Adds the top two elements on the stack.

BINARY_ADD: Adds the result from the exponentiation operation (top of the stack) to the constant 98 (next on the stack).
RETURN_VALUE: Returns the top of the stack as the function's result.

RETURN_VALUE: Returns the result of the addition as the function's output.
